== Status

*Travis C/I* Project Health -

== Purpose

A Gradle project for Groovy users who need utility code to copy text strings to system clipboards. Clone includes gradle build tool wrapper and folder structure like maven/gradle so you don't need an installed gradle build tool.

== DropBox or Google Drive Enabled ?

This trick works nicely if you have a shared drive service like *Dropbox*, or *Google Drive* etc. and all your internal systems use the same *Dropbox*,etc. account.

On one of my least-used systems, did the following:

.Gradle Continuous Doctor Translation
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Dropbox
git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/DoctorPepper.git
cd ~/Dropbox/DoctorPepper
gradlew -t asciidoctor
----

The *-t* option keeps gradle running in continuous mode so now any changes i make to any asciidoctor files are near-instantly
translated for me.

NOTE: If you don't have a *git* client https://git-scm.com/downloads[click here to install one]

.This is a comment for the text that follows ?
The code we write today and tomorrow will probably never run on a single processor system: parallel hardware has become standard.  Not so with the software though, at least not yet. 

.Pre-requisites
 . Working internet connection
 . Installed Git client to copy/clone this repo
 . Ability to use terminal console

.Steps  
 . Open terminal console
 . Change directory \( cd \) into target folder location
 . Run this command to create a folder and copy down all the pieces :

   git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/F5.git

 . *cd F5/*
 . *./gradlew* runs defined tasks to build and test code samples
 . After prior step completes, examine *F5/* folder to find the */build/* folder with test results

== Usage Notes

The *Copier.groovy* source has methods to interact with the System Clipboard of most O/S types.

=== Put text on System Clipboard 

.Method Layout
----
public void copy(String s) 
----

This is a class method to do the deed. Call this method with a Java/Groovy or JVM language _String_ types to place that string on to the System Clipboard of the operating system. Only _String_ copies are supported.

.Method Sample
----
Copier ck = new Copier();
       ck.copy("Hi from me");
----


=== Get Text from System Clipboard 

.Method Layout
----
public String paste() 
----

This is a class method to do the deed. Call this method with a Java/Groovy or JVM language to receive a _String_ type from System Clipboard of the operating system. Only _String_ copies are supported.

.Method Sample
----
Copier ck = new Copier();
def what = ck.paste();
