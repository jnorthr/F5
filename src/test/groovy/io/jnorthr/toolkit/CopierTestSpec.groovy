/*
Feature methods are the heart of a specification. They describe the features (properties, aspects) that you expect to find in the system under specification. By convention, feature methods are named with String literals. Try to choose good names for your feature methods, and feel free to use any characters you like!

Conceptually, a feature method consists of four phases:

 . Set up the feature's fixture
 . Provide a stimulus to the system under specification
 . Describe the response expected from the system
 . Clean up the feature's fixture
 . Whereas the first and last phases are optional, the stimulus and response phases are always present (except in interacting feature methods), and may occur more than once.

  // Second Test

    then:    
		// Asserts are implicit and not need to be stated.
		"pasted by CopierTestSpec" == ck.copy();
  } // end of test
  
} // end of spec
